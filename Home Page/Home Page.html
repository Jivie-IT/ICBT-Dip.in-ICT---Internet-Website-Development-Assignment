        <p style="color: white;">A Journey of Flavor, Fusion, and Culture
            At Subara Bitesu, we don't just serve food - we craft experiences. Born from a deep love for two rich
            culinary traditions, our restaurant is a cultural crossroads where the fiery soul of Sri Lanka meets the
            refined artistry of Japan.

            This is fusion cuisine reimagined - bold, exciting, and uniquely ours.

        <h3 style="color:#FFD700; text-align:left; margin-bottom:20px;"> Fusion That Tells a Story </h3>
        <p style="color: white;">Our name, Subara Bitesu, reflects more than just a fusion of flavors - it's a
            celebration of harmony.
            ‚ÄúSubara‚Äù evokes the elegance and simplicity of Japan, while ‚ÄúBitesu‚Äù - inspired by the playful spirit of Sri
            Lankan hospitality - invites you to savor, share, and experience food in a whole new way.
            Every dish we create is a carefully balanced dance between heat and umami, spice and subtlety, crunch and
            calm. Imagine a tempura kottu. A miso curry. A wasabi sambal. It's wild, it's creative, and it works -
            because it's made with heart.</p>

        <h3 style="color:#FFD700; text-align:left; margin-bottom:20px;">The Subaru Bitesu Experience</h3>
        <p style="color: white;"> From the moment you step inside, you're immersed in an atmosphere that blends modern
            Asian design with warm,
            island energy. Bamboo textures meet tropical greens. Japanese minimalism meets vibrant Lankan rhythm.
            Our chefs, trained in both culinary traditions, bring passion and precision to every plate. Using fresh,
            locally-sourced ingredients and house-made sauces, we create dishes that feel familiar yet excitingly
            different.
            Our menu ranges from signature fusion rolls and fiery ramen with Ceylon curry infusions, to sushi platters
            with tropical twists, spicy rice bowls, umami-packed street bites, and sweet treats that blend mochi with
            Lankan jaggery.</p>

        <h3 style="color:#FFD700; text-align:left; margin-bottom:20px;">More Than Just a Meal</h3>
        <p style="color: white;">At Subara Bitesu, dining is an adventure. It's where cultures connect, where stories
            are shared over steaming
            bowls and sizzling plates. Whether you're here for a quick bite or a long, laid-back meal with friends, we
            welcome you with open arms and open hearts.

            This is not your typical fusion restaurant. This is Subaru Bitesu - where the flavors of Sri Lanka and Japan
            collide in the most delicious way possible.</p>

        <p style="color: white; text-align: center;"> Come for the food. Stay for the vibe.
            Leave with your tastebuds awakened.
            Every bite tells a Story.
        </p>

        <h3 style="color:#FFD700; margin-top:25px;">Our Philosophy</h3>
        <p style="color: white;">We honor the Japanese principle of "shun" - using ingredients at their seasonal peak.
            Our sushi rice is prepared with Sri Lankan red rice for a unique local twist, while our sashimi features the
            freshest daily catch from Sri Lankan waters.</p>
